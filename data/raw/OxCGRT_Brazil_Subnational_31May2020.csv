There were also press conferences and ads in the traditional media. The first Instagram post raising awareness about preventive measures in the state government's account (@govmatogrosso) was on March 30, which I considered the start date of this policy.     On May 6, Governor Mauro Mendes was considered the governor who devoted the most time to address Covid in his profile. Of the total of 495 posts since March 1, he reserved 74% to alert the state population about the health crisis (source below).    In the city of Rondonopolis, in the end of April, sound-equipped cars also circulated in neighborhoods to spread information and orient citizens on preventive measures in their homes. However, it appears to be a city government measure.
